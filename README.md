Title: Glycated hemoglobin A1c variability score elicits kidney function decline in Chinese people living with type 2 diabetes

Summary: 
The fluctuation of HbA1c between visits elicits the quality of care and could impact long-term health outcomes. HbA1c variability score (HVS), an easy-to-interpret novel parameter of HbA1c variability, predicts new-onset chronic kidney disease in Scottish adults but unclear with kidney disease progression. eGFR slope is a recently valid surrogate outcome for kidney disease progression. With a large Chinese cohort, our study suggested for the first time that people with type 2 diabetes and HVS over 60% are facing an extra eGFR decline of â‰¥0.75 mL/min/1.73m2 per year compared to those with HVS below 20%. This finding implies the review of the HbA1c reads and inspection of HVS in practice may facilitate the identification of people at high risk of kidney function decline in adults with type 2 diabetes.
